In EE-Emerge student teams conceive, design and build interactive electronic systems to appeal to the general public. EE-Emerge offers participants the opportunity to develop and apply their basic electrical and computer engineering principles to create an interactive technology exhibit accessible to the general public.

In the Fall EE-Emerge participants define the scope of the exhibits, design teams are formed, and they explore critical elements and decide on final exhibit pieces. During the Winter quarter the electronic systems are implemented and tested for demonstration in early Spring during Picnic Day.

EE-Emerge is primarily for engineering majors in their junior year with an interest in computer engineering, electrical engineering and computer science. Sophomores are allowed to participate. 


Our project, SnapLights, uses face recognition and clap detection to play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. To do face detection, we use the OpenMV H7 Camera to detect faces. The players moves their face around to control their spot on the Tic-Tac-Toe grid. Then they doubled-clap to confirm their spot. Players take turns playing. For clap detection, we have a digital microphone. It senses sound vibration on the drum, and then amplifies it with an op-amp.
