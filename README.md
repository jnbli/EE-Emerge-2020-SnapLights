# SnapLights

SnapLights is a two-player Tic Tac Toe game on a 3x3 grid. Players choose their spot with their face and double clap to confirm. The first to claim three spots in a row wins!

# Getting Started

The early idea was to have a finger snap turn on a set of lights, by Jonathan. In discussions, Aldric convinced the team to pivot the project to be an interactive game.
