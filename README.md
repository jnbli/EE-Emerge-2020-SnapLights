# SnapLights

Snaplights is project that uses face recognition and clap detection to play the game of tic-tac-toe. It is a two-player game. In this project, 9 neopixel LEDs are arranged in 3-by-3 patterns in a wooden frame with a camera and a microphone attached to the frame. The Open MV H7 camera is used for the face recognition, the KY-037 Microphone sensor is used of the clap detection, and the 8-by-8 adafruit neopixel is used of the display of the output. Players choose their spot with their face and double clap to confirm. The first to claim three spots in a row wins!

# Getting Started

The early idea was to have a finger snap turn on a set of lights, by Jonathan. In discussions, Aldric convinced the team to pivot the project to be an interactive game.
