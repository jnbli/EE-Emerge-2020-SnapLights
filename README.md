# EE-Emerge 2020 SnapLights

Originally conceived to be about snapping to on and off some lights, Snaplights is now an fun and exciting 2-player Tic Tac Toe game. To play, you move your face around to choose your spot on the 3x3 grid and confirm your spot by double clapping. Why play it? Because it is a fun new way to interact and play with an familiar game with a peer. Link to our project home page coming soon!

# Getting Started


To build the Tic Tac Toe you will need hardware and software. Hardware needed to physically construct the physical include 9 Adafruit neopixels, a TI MSP430, and an OpenMV Camera.

Software will be C++ on Energia for the MSP430 and Python for the OpenMV Camera, as well as Fusion 360 to design the CAD enclosure, and Altimaker Cura to 3D print it.


This section should provide instructions for other developers to

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Dependencies

Describe what software and libraries you will need to install in order to build and use this project. Provide details on how to resolve these dependencies.

Remember: git-lfs is a dependency that developers will need to resolve before they can get started with a repo using LFS.
